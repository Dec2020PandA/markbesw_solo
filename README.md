### Proposal for Solo Project: Holiday Greetings Prototype

Holiday Greetings will be a website where members post greetings in the form of text, images, and a video. Then they send email invitations to family and friends to view it. It is a membership site, therefore the landing page does login and registration. 

Holiday Greetings will be a group project. This solo project is a prototype to test out some of the key pieces of the final site: image upload, linking to a video storage site, and sending email from the site. 

## Features 
1. P0: Registration & login, ability to create a greeting with text, upload an image, send email invitation.
2. P1: Video upload, enough styling to be visually appealing, useful error messages, e.g. invalid email address.
3. P2: Set up a test harness with Selenium, member comments, downsample images to conserve file storage.
4. P3: TBD

## New challenges (to me, at least)
1. Send email from a site.
2. Image upload using Python/Django.
3. Video upload.
4. Use Selenium for automated test generation.
