### Proposal for Solo Project: Outdoor Adventures

***First pass: more to come***

Outdoor Adventures is a website where members post their outdoor adventure memories. Document your adventure with text, a map, and images. It is a membership site, therefore the landing page does login and registration.

## Features
1. P0: Registration, login, ability to create posts, which include a textarea description, a map, and optional images.
2. P1: Image upload, enough styling to be visually appealing, useful error messages, e.g. invalid email address.
3. P2: Set up a test harness with Selenium, member comments, downsample images to conserve file storage, ability to draw on map, e.g. draw the trail taken.
4. P3: Allow links to videos, contour lines on the map, 

## New chalenges (to me, at least)
1. Learn Google Maps API
2. Learn how to do image upload using Python/Django.
3. (P2) Get basic experience with Selenium for automated test generation.
4. (P2) learn how to do drawing overlays on Google maps.
